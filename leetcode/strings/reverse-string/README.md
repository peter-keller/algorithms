# Reverse string

- Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.
- Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i] is a printable ascii character.`

### Example 1

  > Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
  Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

### Example 2

  > Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
  Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

## Solution(s)

Two pointer approach
`Time Complexity:  O(n)`
